📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage responsible disclosure.

📬 Where to Report
Email: [cypherpunknft@gmail.com]
GitHub: Submit a Private Security Advisory
We ask that you do not file public issues for security-related topics. Please provide a clear description and any relevant proof-of-concept, logs, or screenshots.

🔄 What to Expect

We aim to review all security reports. While we can’t guarantee specific response timelines, we generally follow these informal guidelines:

Initial acknowledgment: Typically within 72 hours
Assessment & reproduction: Within 5–10 business days, depending on complexity
Patch or mitigation plan: If validated, we'll work internally to address the issue
Disclosure coordination: We'll notify you if/when we intend to publicly disclose the issue
We may choose not to publicly disclose all security-related fixes. Our handling of each report depends on severity, scope, and potential impact.

🧭 Scope & Guidance

This policy applies primarily to vulnerabilities that:

Could result in unauthorized access to user data or system resources
Allow code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service
Pose risks via prompt injection or AI misuse leading to critical actions
Not covered:

Minor bugs or feature limitations
Model output that is undesirable but not dangerous
Issues originating from third-party services or dependencies
Social engineering attacks not related to our codebase
🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We value the work of independent security researchers and ethical hackers. While we don't currently offer a bounty program, we may provide public credit in release notes, at our discretion.

Your efforts help us build safer AI tools, and we appreciate your collaboration.
